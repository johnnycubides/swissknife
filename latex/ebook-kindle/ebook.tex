% Allows the imported file to use its own directory as the base path for relative
% file references. For example, a file imported from sub/folder can correctly
% reference images/pic.png from its own directory
% \subimport{../src/}{content.tex}

% All relative paths are interpreted relative to the main .tex file. This causes
% issues with nested folder structures if an imported file has its own internal
% relative file references.
